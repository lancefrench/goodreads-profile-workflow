# Goodreads profile workflow

Automatically update your README with what you're currently reading—or any other Goodreads reading shelf of yours.

### How to use
- Go to your repository
- Add the following section to your **README.md** file, you can give whatever title you want. Just make sure that you use `<!-- GOODREADS-LIST:START --><!-- GOODREADS-LIST:END -->` in your readme. The workflow will replace this comment with the actual list of currently reading books: 

```markdown
### Books I'm currently reading
<!-- GOODREADS-LIST:START -->
<!-- GOODREADS-LIST:END -->
```

- Create a folder named `.github` and create a `workflows` folder inside it if it doesn't exist.
- Create a new file named `goodreads-profile-workflow.yml` with the following contents inside the workflows folder:

```yaml
name: Latest book list from a goodreads
on:
  schedule: # Run workflow automatically
    # This will make it run every hour
    - cron: "0 * * * *"
    # Run workflow manually (without waiting for the cron to be called), through the Github Actions Workflow page directly
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  update-readme-with-goodreads-books:
    name: Update this repo's README with what you're currently reading
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: zwacky/goodreads-profile-workflow@main
        with:
          # Replace this with your goodreads user id
          goodreads_user_id: "92930971"
          shelf: "currently-reading"
```

- Replace the above `goodreads_user_id` with yours. To find out your user ID go to "My Books" on Goodreads and you'll see it in the URL.
- Commit and wait for it to run automatically or you can also trigger it manually to see the result instantly. To trigger the workflow manually check out [this blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) by GitHub.
